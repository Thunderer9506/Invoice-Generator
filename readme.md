# Invoice Generator

A simple Python desktop application for generating invoices using a pre-designed Word template (`template.docx`).  
The app allows you to input client and order details, automatically calculates totals (including IGST, CGST, and SGST), and exports the invoice as a PDF.

## Notes
- Ensure LibreOffice is installed and its executable path is correctly set in the script (`soffice.exe`).

- The placeholder tags (like `[Date]`, `[Invoice]`, `[clientName]`) in `template.docx` must match the ones used in the code.

- This project is not for local use every template can have its own structure, you can fork this project only if you find some kind of error in it and want to fix or want to take idea to build you own project
